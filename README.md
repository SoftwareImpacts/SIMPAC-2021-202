# RIROSE-Rational-Information-Retrieval-in-Online-Search-Environments
The code corresponds to a benchmark algorithm that mimics the sequential behavior of users when retrieving information from the set of alternatives provided by an 
engine within the first page of online search results. The algorithm accounts for the 2,047 nodes composing the binary decision tree defined by the ten alternatives 
ranked within the first page of results. The flexibility of the algorithm allows to incorporate modifications accounting for search frictions and different degrees 
of impatience on the side of users, as well as testing the categorization capacities of machine learning techniques.
